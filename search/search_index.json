UVs are aligned with object's up axis by default. Ideal for directional textures e.g. bricks, tiles, wood, leaks etc.</li> <li>Stable UVs. Unlike other procedural UV solutions, the projections are stable by default and don't jump around as you change your model* </li> <li>Live UVs. All projection types are available as modifiers meaning your UVs can be created in real-time as you model.</li> <li>Direct Tools. You can also use the tools directly in mesh edit mode for fast manual UV unwrapping/transforming.</li> </ol> <p>*Stable UVs are designed for tiling materials where UVs can overlap. UV maps that require packing will not be stable.</p>"},{"location":"#where-can-i-get-uvproject","title":"Where can I get uvProject?","text":"<p>Blender 4.1+ Recommended (Blender 4.0+ Required)</p> <p>uvProject is available on Gumroad and will be released on Blender Market for version 1.0</p> <ul> <li> Gumroad </li> </ul>"},{"location":"examples/","title":"Examples","text":""},{"location":"how_to_use/","title":"How to Use","text":""},{"location":"install/","title":"Install uvProject","text":"<p>uvProject is installed as an asset library in Blender.</p> <p>Tldr: download the zip, extract the folder, and add the folder as an asset library.
